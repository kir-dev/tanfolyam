    // Extra Task 1.4: Create an endpoint to list the results.
    // For example: GET /api/form-responses

    // Extra Task 1.5: Optional: Validate the form responses.
    // See: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-bean-validation
    // or come up with your own (e.g. add a model attribute called error and if it is not null show it to the user)
